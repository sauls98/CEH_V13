    "question": "Buffer overflow mainly occurs when a created memory partition (or buffer) is written beyond its intended boundaries. If an attacker manages to do this from outside the program, this can cause security problems since it can potentially allow them to manipulate arbitrary memory cells, although many modern operating systems protect against the worst cases of this. What programming language is this example in? char a[4]; strcpy(a, \"a string longer than 4 characters\"); printf(\"%s\\n\", a[6]);",
